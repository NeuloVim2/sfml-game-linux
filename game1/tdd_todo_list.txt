v.length()
v.normilize()

process case when scalar is int: 
 vector + 5
 vector - 5

Initiliaze vector with x and y equal to 0 when no default constructor called
 after vector(), vectro.x = 0 and vector.y = 0

Add negate operation for vector: 
  vector v = {x, y} and do -v => -v.x, -v.y 
  vector v = {-x, y} and do -v => v.x, -v.y 
  vector v = {x, -y} and do -v => -v.x, v.y 
  vector v = {-x, -y} and do -v => v.x, v.y 

Compare two vector for equalaty
 vector1 == vector2
 vector1 != vector2

fix issue with increased players' velocity when moving diagonally - done

move spawnBullet() in a dircetion of mouse - done
generate enemies with different color - done
display on GUI all existing entity; separate tab - done
