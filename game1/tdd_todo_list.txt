scalar multiplication: vector * 3.0f

process case when scalar is int: 
 vector + 5
 vector - 5

Initiliaze vector with x and y equal to 0 when no default constructor called
 after vector(), vectro.x = 0 and vector.y = 0

Add negate operation for vector: -vector

Compare two vector for equalaty
 vector1 == vector2
 vector1 != vector2
